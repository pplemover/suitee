## Roadmap
This is a brief overview of future improvements.
1. Create a Django model to represent a user's page. (Users can customize (1) custom app and widgets & location, (2) preferred background)
2. Create a view that allows users to create and eit their page. This view uses Django's authentication system to ensure that only the owner of the page can edit it.
3. Create a 'home' template that displays the user's page. This template should use Django's template language to render the content that the user has customized.  
4. Login screen Creation
5. Create a URL pattern that mpas to the view created in step 2. This URL should include a unique identifier for the user's page, such as the user's username or a random UUID.
6. Add Google Login.
7. Create first set of Built-in apps & Widgets ((1) Album, (2) Clock, (3) Calculator)
8. Add a feature that allows users to add website-linked apps to home screen.
