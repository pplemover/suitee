## Apps and Widgets
- Bookmarks in a Chrome or Edge browser provide a convenient way to access frequently visited webpages. Users can quickly navigate to their saved webpages, saving time and effort.
- However bookmarks can be quite annoying since it is hard to recognize which is which when there are a bunch of bookmark. As the number of bookmarks increases, organizing and maintaining the bookmark list may require time and effort.
- An `app` in SUITEE is simply a bookmark, an URL address to another 3rd party website. But in SUITEE, `app`s can be grouped by its form, properties, and functions. 
- A `widget` is a simple extension of a function of an `app`. Widgets come in various sizes, are customizable, and can be placed on any availble `home panel` for quick access. For example, a to-do widget provides a quick screen of upcoming to-do items without opening the to-do app.
- User selection of `app`s and `widget`s are stored in the cloud, enabling synchronization across different devices and browsers.
